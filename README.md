# Random Raffle Contracts

## About

My first smart contract lottery.

## What does it do?

    Users can enter by paying for a ticket
        The ticket fees are going to go to the winner during the draw. And the host contract will keep its share of 5%.
    After X period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner
        And this will be done programattcally
    Using Chainlink VRF & Chainlink Automation
        Chainlink VRF => Randomness
        Chainlink Automation => Time based trigger
